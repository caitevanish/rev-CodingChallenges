/*
Create a function that takes the dimensions of two triangles (as arrays)
and checks if the first triangle fits into the second one.

Examples

doesTriangleFit([1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]) ➞ true
doesTriangleFit([1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]) ➞ true
doesTriangleFit([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2]) ➞ false
doesTriangleFit([1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6]) ➞ false

Notes

Triangle fits if it has the same or smaller size as the hole.

The function should return false if the triangle with those dimensions is not possible.
